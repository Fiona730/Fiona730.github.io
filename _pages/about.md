About Me
------
I am a second year Computer Science master student at [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch), specializing in Computer Graphics. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn) in 2020.

As an ethusiast of rendering, I am particularly captivated by the field of **physically-based rendering**, while real-time rendering also piques my interest. I find rendering algorithms fascinating as they utilize a broad range of knowledge and skills, including the principles of physics, mathematical tools, computer science theory, and clever software engineering tricks to produce spectacular visual effects on-screen. My passion for rendering is self-motivating, driving me to explore cutting-edge research papers and tinker with code.

During the pandemic-induced gap year in 2021, I had the opportunity to work full-time as a graphics engineer and technical artist at [Nuverse](https://www.nvsgames.com/sg), the game studio of [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/).

Although I have previously worked on computer vision and deep learning during my undergraduate studies, my current focus is exclusively on computer graphics.

In my leisure time, I enjoy creating digital illustrations and watching musicals.
