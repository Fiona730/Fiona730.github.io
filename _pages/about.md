About Me
------
I am a Computer Science master student at [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch), specializing in Computer Graphics. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn) in 2020.

My research and working interest focus on **physically-based rendering** and light transport algorithms. I find rendering fascinating and romantic as it utilizes a broad range of knowledge and skills, including the principles of physics, mathematical tools, computer science theory, and clever software engineering tricks to produce spectacular visual effects on-screen.

Throughout my master's studies, I am fortunate enough to work with supervisors from [Disney Research Zurich](https://studios.disneyresearch.com) and [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) on volume rendering and path guiding. It was an enriching experience to explore and improve state-of-the-art in physically-based rendering.

During my gap year in 2021, I worked full-time as a graphics engineer on real-time rendering for a mobile game at [Nuverse](https://www.nvsgames.com/sg), the game studio under [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/).

I also worked on computer vision and deep learning during my undergraduate studies. In my leisure time, I enjoy creating digital illustrations and watching musicals.
