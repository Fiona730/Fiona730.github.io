About Me
------
I am a second year Computer Science master student at [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch), majoring in Computer Graphics. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn) in 2020.

I am an ethusiast for rendering, especially the field of physcially-based rendering, but real-time rendering also interests me. I am mesmerized by rendering algorithms in that they create amazing on-screen visual effects based on a broad range of knowledge and skills: the principles of physics, mathematical tools, computer science theory and clever software engineering tricks. When it comes to rendering, I am self-motivated to research state-of-the-art papers and play with the code.

I had a gap year during the pandemic in 2021, and worked as a full time graphics engineer and techinical artist at [Nuverse](https://www.nvsgames.com/sg), the game studio of [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/).

I used to work on computer vision and deep learning during my bachelor, but is now fully devoted to the field of computer grpahics.

I draw digital illustration and enjoy watching musicals in my leisure time.
